title: PNAS旧文：产业生态学作为一门新兴的管理科学
summary: Pollution is a complex equation, compounded by population, rate of
  consumption, and toxic emissions per unit of resource consumed. This article
  defines industrial ecology as a management science that focuses a
  corporation's expertise on the third variable. Thus, industrial ecology is
  involved with changing the efficiency of machines, not just changing the law
  or a firm's compliance strategy. This article also explores how this emphasis
  allows a profoundly different orientation than the end-of-the-pipe regulatory
  approach of the last 20 yr.
