abstract: Electricity transmissions have been utilized in China to balance its
  spatially mismatched development needs and natural resources endowments.
  However, it has led to spatial shifts of negative environmental impacts
  induced by electricity generations, including water consumption and carbon
  emissions. This study calculates that, from 2010 to 2016, carbon emissions and
  water consumption to produce the transmitted electricity have grown from 507
  Mt and 2.7 km3 respectively to 642 Mt and 6.5 km3. Applying a structural
  decomposition model coupled with a Quasi-Input-Output model to quantify the
  driving factors of such increases, we find that GDP increase has played the
  dominant role in driving the increase of both factors. Our results also
  highlight the potential conflicts between carbon reduction and water
  conservation in developing future electricity transmission infrastructure
  systems. Changing the electric power sector's energy portfolio and the
  transmission structure by increasingly utilizing hydropower productions have
  both contributed to national total carbon emissions reductions, but at the
  expenses of increased national water consumption. As a result, on a national
  level, in 2016, due to the inter-provincial differences in energy portfolios
  and technologies, electricity transmissions have led to 155.27 Mt of net
  carbon reduction and 3.4 kmÂ³ of additional net water consumption compared to
  the counterfactual scenario where no electricity transmission were
  facilitated. The future expansion of electricity transmission network needs to
  consider such trade-offs, particularly within the contexts of global climate
  change mitigation and emergent challenges posed by water stresses.
