abstract: Carbon neutrality ambitions require a clean, reliable, and affordable
  supply of critical metals used in low-carbon technologies ranging from wind
  turbines, photovoltaics, and electricity networks, to electric vehicles. Based
  on real-world examples and preliminary assessments, we propose a novel
  circular metal-energy nexus to explore their critical interlinkages and
  emerging challenges, highlighting the urgency of incorporating circular
  economy strategies into such a nexus for the deep-decarbonization of energy,
  metal, and other key services to boost the carbon-neutral transition. However,
  if these interactions were not systematically managed at the international
  level, the rising metal-energy conflicts could intensify geopolitical
  conflicts and hinder low-carbon innovations, which jeopardizes our
  climate-safe future. This cover presents such a symbiosis of critical metals
  and renewable energy in a carbon-neutral landscape.
