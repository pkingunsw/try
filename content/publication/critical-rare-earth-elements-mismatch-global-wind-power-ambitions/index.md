summary: In 2019, the United Nations called for more ambitious climate action to
  prevent catastrophic climate change. Decarbonizing our energy systems is one
  of the most important actions we can take. In response, many countries have
  developed ambitious plans to expand wind power. However, wind turbines heavily
  rely on rare-earth elements (REs), and it remains unclear whether supply can
  meet demand. We investigated potential conflicts between RE demand and supply
  across ten global regions up to 2050 under four widely recognized climate
  scenarios. We found that RE supply capacity to support ambitious system-wide
  wind-power development is likely to be hindered by the monopolistic structure
  of the RE supply chain and intensified geopolitical and environmental
  constraints, and an 11- to 26-fold increase in production will be necessary to
  meet ambitious wind-power-expansion targets. To overcome these RE supply
  challenges, we highlight the importance of facilitating free trade and
  diversifying RE production via global cooperation.
