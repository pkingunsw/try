publication_short: The Material Basis of Energy Transitions
abstract: There is an ongoing major transition to low-carbon energy worldwide,
  which makes energy systems more dependent on critical metals (e.g., rare-earth
  elements, cobalt, etc.). The need to secure a stable supply of those critical
  metals for emerging energy technologies has attracted global attention. In
  this context, it becomes increasingly important to explore the metal-energy
  nexus and identify corresponding strategies. This chapter introduces the
  context, framework, implementation, and implications of the mineral-energy
  nexus in the global energy transition, and highlights the importance and
  necessity of incorporating material cycles into this framework. Under the
  guidance of this nexus perspective, we then explore the global metal cycles of
  18 types of energy-critical metals and investigate their key concerns. To
  guarantee a successful energy transition, there is a strong need to
  incorporate the metal system into energy policy making, and this chapter urges
  stakeholders throughout the material cycle to take actions and promote more
  sustainable and collaborative production, consumption, trade, and recycling of
  those energy-related metals.
