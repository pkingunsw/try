abstract: Steel production is a difficult-to-mitigate sector that challenges
  climate mitigation commitments. Efforts for future decarbonization can benefit
  from understanding its progress to date. Here we report on greenhouse gas
  emissions from global steel production over the past century (1900-2015) by
  combining material flow analysis and life cycle assessment. We find that ~45
  Gt steel was produced in this period leading to emissions of ~147 Gt CO2-eq.
  Significant improvement in process efficiency (~67%) was achieved, but was
  offset by a 44-fold increase in annual steel production, resulting in a
  17-fold net increase in annual emissions. Despite some regional technical
  improvements, the industry’s decarbonization progress at the global scale has
  largely stagnated since 1995 mainly due to expanded production in emerging
  countries with high carbon intensity. Our analysis of future scenarios
  indicates that the expected demand expansion in these countries may jeopardize
  steel industry’s prospects for following 1.5 °C emission reduction pathways.
  To achieve the Paris climate goals, there is an urgent need for rapid
  implementation of joint supply- and demand-side mitigation measures around the
  world in consideration of regional conditions.
