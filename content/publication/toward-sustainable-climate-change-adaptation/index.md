abstract: Industrial ecology (IE) has made great contributions to climate change
  mitigation research, in terms of its systems thinking and solid methodologies
  such as life cycle assessment, material flow analysis, and environmentally
  extended inputâ€“output analysis. However, its potential contribution to climate
  change adaptation is unclear. Adaptation has become increasingly urgent in a
  continuously changing climate, especially in developing countries, which are
  projected to bear the brunt of climate-change-related damages. On the basis of
  a brief review of climate change impacts and adaptation literature, we suggest
  that IE can play an important role in the following two aspects. First, with
  the emphasis on a systems perspective, IE can help us determine how climate
  change interacts with our socio-economic system and how the interactions may
  aggravate (or moderate) its direct impacts or whether they may shift burden to
  other environmental impacts. Second, IE methodologies can help us quantify the
  direct and indirect environmental impacts of adaptation activities, identify
  mitigation opportunities, and achieve sustainable adaptation. Further, we find
  that substantial investment is needed to increase the resilience of
  infrastructure (e.g., transport, energy, and water supply) and agriculture in
  developing countries. Because these sectors are also the main drivers of
  environmental degradation, how to achieve sustainable climate-resilient
  infrastructure and agriculture in developing countries deserves special
  attention in future IE studies. Overall, IE thinking and methodologies have
  great potential to contribute to climate change adaptation research and policy
  questions, and exploring this growing field will, in turn, inspire IE
  development.
