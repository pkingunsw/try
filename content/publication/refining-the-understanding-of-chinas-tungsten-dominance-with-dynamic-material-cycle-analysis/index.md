abstract: Tungsten is deemed a critical raw material by many nations, given its
  irreplaceable use in industrial and military applications. In particular, much
  concern has been drawn to China's high share in global tungsten supply. While
  various studies have focused on the criticality of tungsten, few have
  specifically explored how tungsten is produced, consumed, and traded. In this
  paper, the dynamic material flow analysis is applied to quantify China's
  annual tungsten cycle from 1949 – 2017. It is estimated that total tungsten
  mined from ores in China over the past 68-year period is ~2500 kilo-tons (kt).
  Among those, ~750 kt of tungsten has been exported to other countries, and
  around 970 kt tungsten is domestically consumed. It is noted ≈1720 kt has been
  lost from mining, production, and end-of-life stage, and merely ~130 kt has
  been recycled as end-of-life scrap. Our material flow analysis further refined
  China's tungsten dominance. Although China currently dominates the global
  production of tungsten, this dominance will not extend too far into the future
  given China's limited share of world tungsten reserves and its declining ore
  quality. Our trade flow analysis reveals that China imported ~35 kt of high
  value-added downstream tungsten products from outside manufacturers, whose
  mineral resource was originally imported from China. At present, China by
  itself is experiencing overcapacity issues in the primary production, which
  discourages the recycling of at end-of-life (EoL) stage and makes the EoL
  recycling rate only 10%. It is noted that the percentage of Chinese tungsten
  for domestic consumption has been increasing in the past few years. This
  highlights the need for systematic measures from stakeholders along the
  tungsten cycle to promote sustainable practices for efficient tungsten
  production, use, and recycling in China. Meanwhile, the results also suggest
  the importance of monitoring the criticality of tungsten and other critical
  minerals from a dynamic and material cycle perspective.
